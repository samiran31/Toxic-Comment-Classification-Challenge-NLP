they\\'re full of hilarious altercations i\\'ve had with friends and critics, and will keep you entertained for hours. why not try the \"\"random discussion generator\"\" by entering an archive and choosing a random heading, then reading the relevant text - it\\'s pot luck madness! or maybe you\\'re a publisher looking for a new form of coffee table literature with a view to making one lucky, stubborn and argumentative wikipedia contributer a household name. look no further. god has smiled upon you this day - i am your man. more likely, you\\'re an admin, looking to see how many times i\\'ve been blocked before so you can give me a really big block becuase i\\'ve called a fellow wikipedian a \"\"fucking useless tosser, i\\'ll kill you!\"\" - let me save you some time: i have never once been blocked (yes, that ought to do. what a good cover).\" \"\\nno seriousy.  the only thing i think actually did or said against your precious wikipedia policies was saying that \"\"if i really had my way, half of you would be shot\"\".  ignoring for a while the fact that i was obviously joking, it happens to be my religious belief that the human race on a whole would be much, much better off if 95% of the population died tomorrow.  that doesn\\'t mean i go around killing people, or making specific death threats against individuals.  and don\\'t you actually have the sense to realize that if someone says \"\"oh my god you are such a fucking idiot, just go die already\"\" that they probably don\\'t want you to die, or more accurately they don\\'t care.  very few people actually have the emotion required to sit and pray for the death of another person or group of people.  and i am not one of those people.\\n\\nif you really wanted to show off what a horrible and insensitive person i am,  edit, which was on a wiki talk page, is probably not the best.  granted, nothing pisses me off more than people who see letters like я and щ and automatically assume that whatever is written is russian.  the cyrillic alphabet is used in many slavic languages, as well as central asian former soviet republics, and even mongolia.  so i called someone an idiot.  boo fucking hoo.  maybe he could have said \"\"what language is that?\"\" instead of assuming that it was russian.  however insulted he was by me calling him an idiot, i can guarantee you that i was at least 10 times as insulted by him calling that russian.  i am a proud, native russian, and will not have my culture besmirched with these allegations.\\n\\nyour other example how i am a bad contributor is what, a spelling correction?  or was it the fact that my edit summary was how i felt about the sad fact that niggers can\\'t spell? don\\'t even think about raising issue of my use of the word.  i live in harlem.  around here, that word is used like a comma.  and before you try to tell me the difference between \"\"nigga\"\" and \"\"nigger\"\", there is none.  it\\'s called a dialect.  while for some purposes, it makes sense to write things phonetically as they are pronounced by the person saying them, i find it is usually clearer to spell properly.  also, a nigger, to me at least, is not a \"\"black person\"\". i am not a racist. i do not even draw distinctions between people. in my holy opinion, there is a nigger inside of all of us.  people (like you, for instance) who take offense for no reason (i mean, was saying \"\"black people are stupid and i think they should be marginalized in society, tarred and feathered, strung up on trees, dragged through town by their enormous wangs, etc.\"\"?  no.  and if that is what you heard, i\\'d like to know why.  are you black?  98% of the black people i know personally use the word \"\"nigger\"\" more than i do.) are why we as a society still can\\'t get over the silly idea that words are harmful.  words are not harmful.  ideas are harmful.  one particularly harmful idea is that certain words are so unspeakably horrible that nobody can be allowed to say them for any reason at all.  you want to end racism forever?  stop freaking the fuck out every time you see the word \"\"nigger\"\".  seriously.  i happen to be a priest (and a docktor), and saving humanity is just one of my many responsibilities.  fucks like you make me hate it, but i still do it.  that\\'s what a good person i am.\\n\\ni forgot what else i was going to complain about.  i mean, i could complain about everything on wikipedia, not because i am uncivil, but because there are enough wikipedos to make this community unbearable for normal, well-adjusted individuals such as myself.  if you look at all my page edits, they were all good for the encyclopedia.  ok, there was one tiny exception - a long time ago, i saw someone changed a caption on scottish fold to \"\"winston churchill\"\".  someone else reverted it, and i reverted it back.  i felt it was an appropriate caption to that particular image.  but everything else was beneficial to improving the quality of the content.  i may be a little hard on people who are hung up on things that are wrong, but i only do what is right.  that is why i put it on my user page.  i don\\'t do wrong things.  if you try to argue with me, you will be in for a world of hurt.  butthurt, to be exact.  but you have nobody to blame but yourself.  unlike you, i actually warn people first.  but no.  you fags have to be humorless, oversensitive, fascist wikipedos with your unwarranted self-importance and your administrative powers.  well you can go fuck yourselves. if you ever succeed in getting all sand out of your vaginas.  i joined wikipedia because i wanted to make it better, and that was all i did.  but i guess you cunts actually enjoy bathing aro i\\'ve requested a change to wolfpuss - congratulations to all dirty thinkers in our community.

(and no, i am not going to use cutesy, euphemistic language. if i were into such deception, i would have become a liar, er, lawyer, and would be worthless as an encyclopedist.) and i was unable to e-mail user: physicq210 because i am not logged in and “you must be logged in and have a valid authenticated e-mail address in your preferences to send e-mail to other users.” (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/special:emailuser/physicq210)\\n\\nif this isn’t cyber-stalinism, i don’t know what is! so, let me get this straight. stalking and censoring an editor while using the equivalent of smiley faces (user: auburnpilot’s penchant for saying “thank you” after vandalizing one’s links) is “civil,” but complaining about such abuse counts as “spam, disruption, incivility, and personal attacks.” if that is verily so, then 2 + 2 = 5.\\n\\np.p.s the message here says that i was “temporarily blocked from editing wikipedia as a result of your disruptive edits.” what the heck is that supposed to mean? for restoring footnotes and links that user: auburnpilot had vandalized? if that constitutes “disruptive edits,” then you’ve utterly given up on honest english and all human

encyclopedia\\njump to: navigation, search\\nfor the crass album, see penis envy (album). for the virgin 1 documentary, see ....envy.\\n\\npenis envy in freudian psychoanalysis refers to the theorized reaction of a girl during her psychosexual development to the realization that she does not have a penis. freud considered this realization a defining moment in the development of gender and sexual identity for women. according to freud, the parallel reaction in boys to the realization that girls do not have a penis is castration anxiety.\\n\\nin contemporary culture, the term is sometimes used symbolically or metaphorically to refer to the idea that women wish they had a penis, or to refer to anxieties between men about the size of their genitals.\\ncontents\\n[hide]\\n\\n    * 1 freud\\'s

also\\n    * 4 references\\n    * 5 external links\\n\\n[edit] freud\\'s theory\\n\\nsigmund freud introduced the concept of a little girl\\'s interest in—and envy of— the penis in his 1908 article \"\"on the sexual theories of children,\"\" but did not fully develop the idea until substantially later in 1914 when his work on narcissism was published. it was not mentioned in the first edition of freud\\'s earlier three contributions to the theory of sex (1905).\\n\\nthe term came to significance as freud gradually refined his views of female sexuality, coming to describe a mental process he believed occurred in girls as they passed through the electra complex from the phallic stage to the latency stage (see psychosexual development).\\n\\nin freud’s psychosexual development theory, the phallic stage (approximately between the ages of 3.5 and 6) is the first period of development in which the libidinal focus is primarily on the genital area. prior to this stage, the libido (broadly defined by freud as the primary motivating energy force within the mind) focuses on other physiological areas. for instance, in the oral stage, in the first 12 to 18 months of life, libidinal needs concentrate on the desire to eat, sleep, suck and bite. the theory suggests that the penis becomes the organ of principal interest to both sexes in the phallic stage. this becomes the catalyst for a series of pivotal events in psychosexual development. these events—known as the oedipus complex for boys and the electra complex for girls—result in significantly different outcomes for each gender because of differences in anatomy.\\n\\nfor girls:\\n\\n    * soon after the libidinal shift to the penis, the child develops her first sexual impulses towards her mother.\\n    * the girl realizes that she is not physically equipped to have a heterosexual relationship with her mother, since she does not have a penis.\\n    * she desires a penis, and the power that it represents. this is described as penis envy. she sees the solution as obtaining her father’s penis.\\n    * she develops a sexual desire for her father.\\n    * the girl blames her mother for her apparent castration (what she sees as punishment by the mother for being attracted to the father) assisting a shift in the focus of her sexual impulses from her mother to her father.\\n    * sexual desire for her father leads to the desire to replace and eliminate her mother.\\n    * the girl identifies with her mother so that she might learn to mimic her, and thus replace her.\\n    * the child anticipates that both aforementioned desires will incur punishment (by the principle of lex talionis)\\n    * the girl employs the defence mechanism of displacement to shift the object of her sexual desires from her father to men in general.\\n\\nthe offshoot of these events, often cited in the media and colloquially, is that a girl really wants to become her mother, so that she can control her father.\\n\\na similar process occurs in boys of the same age as they pass through the phallic stage of development. the key differences being that the focus of sexual impulses need not switch from mother to father, and that the fear of castration (castration anxiety) remains. the boy desires his mother, and identifies with his father, whom he sees as having the object of his sexual impulses. furthermore, the boy’s father, being the powerful aggressor of the family unit, is sufficiently menacing that the boy employs the defense mechanism of displacement to shift the object of his sexual desires from his mother to women in general.\\n\\nfreud thought this series of events occurred prior to the development of a wider sense of sexual identity, and was required for an individual to continue to enter into his or her gen talk dirty to me some more: i really like the fatties do you like girls with something special? http://www.rbblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2006/09/003_resize.jpg 207.237.33.117 i\\'m going to

because there aren\\'t any reliable sources! the sources i see now are laughable and they are not proving anything! in fact, i am suprised that this article is still standing.\\nyes, maybe i have complexes (serbs like that word). \\nfact is, i do not hate normal serbs, i hate only xenophobic serbs spreading lies. and wikipedia is full of them. \\noh yeah, i forgot! you aren\\'t serbs,you are from uk or usa! you have serbian ip\\'s only to deceive racist people ;)))) (sarcasm)\\ncroat with complexes logging out. when people do not piss me off; i will act civil. when people decide to annoy mer; like that person at eurozone did; i have to be incivil; it is the least violent way otl et out anger and annoyance. if people would simply stop annoying me and piussing me off;; then i would be civil. but you cant seem to understand that. pity. worst admin in the world \\n\\nyou performed a global checkuser without any just cause whatsoever.  you went on a \\'fishing expedition\\'.  when your actions are exposed, you will be banned from wikipedia. \"\\n\\n rhobite a hypocrite? \\n\\nbelow is what  wrote on a page discussing blocking \"\"personal attacks.\"\" bold added for emphasis.\\n\\ni\\'m slightly against removing personal attacks. there are too many instances of revert wars on talk pages. also, people should not remove personal attacks that are directed against them - ask someone else. there are too many instances of people in a dispute editing each others\\' comments. rhobite 18:21, jun 23, 2005 (utc) \\n\\nis rhobite a hypocrite? he warned me about a personal attack (which i admit i probably could have worded better). i removed it. i then probably crossed the line making a comment about him (i was just a little upset with him trying to muscle me... see above). he then removed those comments and blocked me for a reason which he never warned me. hypocrite? i think so.  \" \":it is neither more historically correct, nor more professional. scholars routinely use the term \"\"nazi\"\". you cite the encyclopedia britannia as evidence of your claim. but, in fact, the encyclopedia britanica uses nazi an order of magnitude more often than national socialism. in the online version of the encyclopedia, there are 10,200 references to nazi and only 1020 references to \"\"national socialism\"\". and in the title of the entry for \"\"national socialism\"\", they write \"\"also called nazism or naziism\"\". \\n\\nyour claim that use of the term \"\"nazi\"\" is amateurish is a slur on the overwhelming majority of scholars who routinely use the term. the claim that \"\"national socialism\"\" is a \"\"more full and correct designation\"\" is inconsistent with the fact that the two phrases are synonymous. and while it is true that \"\"nazi\"\" can be used as an epithet, so can \"\"dog\"\". do you also recommend that wikipedia refrain from using the word \"\"dog\"\" to describe dogs? \\n\\nit is interesting that you use linder as support for your argument. the particular passage that you link to is an explanation by linder as to why he will use the term \"\"nazi\"\" rather than \"\"national socialist\"\" throughout his book. i fail to see why this is evidence that wikipedia should do the opposite.\\n\\ni am curious about your statement that use of the term nazi arises from a deeper intent by political opponents to give a skewed view of their politics. what part of nazi politics do you feel has been skewed by their political opponents?\\n  \\n\\n\" you guys are victimizing me because of my ethnicity. this is blatant racism. and why and how is it and can it be that the controvery section is longer than the entire description of the firm ?

other.  your chutzpah in describing it as \"\"vandalism\"\" when these bad-faith edits of yours are reverted is stupidity.  are you really so very in love with orlowski that when he rants about

you over \\nexcitable ancient. forgive my antagonism but i give only as much as i receive, and i have most \\ncertainly received a substantial quantity from you. you may try to come across as a cool headed and fair moderator. in reality i would liken you more to a tyrant; nay to an immature little boy, despite your years (oh and so many of them there are). without hardly a glance you toss aside any changes you can\\'t verify with the limitless tome you assume your mind to be. and what of those whose revisions you\\'ve mindlessly reverted, you dispatch to them on mass pseudo-endearments and generic warnings such as the one seen above. i will admit to you that i have committed much wiki-vandalism in the past such as my early editing of neil peart but how is it that you cannot overlook the past and accept the legitimate revisions and improvements i and others have been making. i stand by my edit regarding charles nohh though i have given up trying to penetrate you tightly closed mind (which i will add in my rage is quite the adverse of what i would say about your wife). furthermore having calmed myself i should mention a little about who i am. if you can recall (of this there is little hope) you once likened my writing to that found in \"\"chat-rooms\"\" and believe me when i say i did not lol over that comment. i was at the time of our encounter studying a ba with a major in creative english writing. you should note before you jump to the conclusion that i dropped out as i suspect you would in your typical \"\"angry\"\" way: not only have i graduated, i continued my study for a further year and obtained honors. i was working at the time as a contributor to a wellington based music interest magazine, and had convinced the fuehrer (my editor) to publish an article i wrote on rush. it was while i was researching for this article that i came across the information which i added to the neil peart article. so thanks to you my small contribution was only read by the handful of new zealanders who read my work, when it could have informed in whatever small way the countless many who may have stumbled upon it on the internet. so thank you anger22. it is your obsession with reversion resulting i must assume in a complete disregard of duty to family or perhaps a complete disconnection from the living world, i say again it is this obsession which keeps this

later jumped the shark. it then became the worst show ever (well, not as bad as totally spies or futurama, but got close). also, as for another comment above, teenage robot  was awful. robot jones was way better. and as for the final one, king of the hill was great, but family guy is unfunny. it is better than futurama though, futurama was the absolute worst thing ever made!!!!\\n\\ndon\\'t watch

there were 5 different linked sites that provided help on the da vinci code webquests - 2 were for the original webquest and those links had been here on wikipedia for several years without issue and were the most well-used resources for the webquests on the internet, and then 3 more links were recently added for help with the new google webquests that just started this month. note that these new google webquests are not related to the older original webquests at all, and do not superced them in any manner. one person comes along who has created a new site that provides help only for the new google webquests (and no help whatsoever with the older original webquests), and this prat deletes all the links and information to all the webquest help sites both old and new, and replaces them with his own link, and when several site owners try to put their information back up, this clown repeatedly deletes it ..and then you mods back him up??? wtf is up with that??? please explain your actions??? your page now provides absolutely no links to help with the original webquests, and only one link for help with the new webquest, which is all thanks to this one selfish prat from googlefact.blogspot.com. oh wait, there\\'s one more link too, and that\\'s to his mirror site at davinciquest.blogspot.com. how can you justify your actions? the owner of googlefact.blogspot.com also posted on the site of one of the links he removed (student-rant.blogspot.com), to laugh at everyone and thank us all for the traffic and the ad-impression revenue it is generating for him. and this is what you people seem to condone???? if you could give some reason for your actions then perhaps all of us site owners who were deleted could understand, but we do not see that there is any justification for what you have done, nor has anyone offered any. the only message we\\'re getting here is that it pays to manipulate wikipedia for personal gain and delete everyone else\\'s links but your own. we humbly request you rectify this matter and then lock the page to stop the person who started all this from doing it again - which happens to be the one link you have left on the page. at a bare minimum, restore the help links to the original webquests so people looking for help with them can actually get some. i still can\\'t believe how unjustly you mods have administered this matter so far. i think he was gay \\n\\nwell was he?

course you didn\\'t, per your bias in favor of him, for some reason (a problem on wikipedia that happens with admins and other users...), and sided with his nonsense that somehow \"\"icgc\"\" was somehow \"\"not notable\"\".  never mind that they\\'ve been all over tv talk shows for years, guests on interviews, and in the radio, and even in the news.  never mind that they\\'ve been around for decades.  and have internet sites for years.  you\\'ll knee-jerkly take malik\\'s side on this, because after all, he\\'s \"\"malik shabaz\"\".  a bully on wikipedia who is revert happy, and for some reason you favor.  i do not appreciate your remarks to me on his talk page.   i did not violate anything. nothing.  but malik was arguably violating \"\"i don\\'t like\"\" and \"\"no own\"\".  you\\'ll deny that, because after all, he\\'s malik.  and for whatever reason, whatever he does or says, you (admin or not), seem to knee-jerkly side with.  so now that malik has obvious back-up for his bullying and ownership violations (back-up from an imperfect admin who is arguably a bully too doesn\\'t bode well for me, does it) it\\'s hard for me to do anything.  yes, i\\'m angry.  your remarks were obtuse and unnecessary.  i violated nothing.  malik seems to think he owns a bunch of articles, as is seen from his history and pattern.  yet you wink at it, or deny that, because, well, he\\'s \"\"malik\"\".  good day.   \" hahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahaha vandalism rules vandalism rules vandalism rules vandalism rules vandalism rules vandalism rules vandalism rules vandalism

don\\'t come back! you can ben anything you want on the planet except the pencil on my piece of paper ok? so, take this as a \"\"3r\"\" rule and be civil and stay the hell out of my classroom ok!  \" mate you are clearly a wanker. it\\'s just interesting historically correct article that you (ie. uninteresting internet geeks) have nothing better to do then get involved with. whats the point of this site if people can\\'t write informative articles if nonces like yourself keep getting involved? .\\n\\ni\\'d say he is more of a geek than a nerd this user is a plant from bruce perens and groklaw \\n\\nrevoke his rights and ban him  he\\'s an infiltrator. first of all, i\\'ve never been blocked before.\\n\\nnext, let me be clear: mr. user:aboutmovies vandalized an article. then he argued with and ultimately attacked pcap, the editor who reverted the vandalism. then pcap, presumably out of frustration, asked me for help, as i was the one who had provided most of the original text for that article.  i am not active much anymore on wikipedia, so i mostly just i commiserated on pcap\\'s talk page. i told him i would not get involved. (why am i not active? because there are too many assholes like user:aboutmovies allowed to run free, making life shitty for everyone.)  \\n\\nnow mr. user:aboutmovies, apparently having too much time on his hands, snoops through my personal communications on pcap\\'s talk page. and so, after putting his nose where it doesn\\'t belong, he gets his nose out of whack, and comes to my personal talk page, and attacks me. why? this guy clearly owed pcap an apology. he could have offered an apology. he could have quietly slunk off with his tail between his legs, and repented in private. no, instead of doing the right, honorable thing, he instead chooses to attack me. (so who is escalating? he is.) so i called him an asshole, which he richly deserves. so then he escalates some more: he gets you to block me.  you were sucked right into his game.  you did not bother to do any due diligence. at all. you should have blocked him, not me.  once you realized your mistake, which pcap points out to you above, you could have offered me an apology, turned around, and blocked aboutmovies instead. did you bother to do any of these things? no.  you fucked up.\\n\\nso to summarize: fuck off tedder. you are part of the problem, and not part of the solution. the sooner we get rid of fucking asshole admins like you, the better wikipedia will be. \"== \"\"mujahideen\"\" ==\\n\\nwheres your proof of mujahideen in kosovo, an article about bosnia, how stupid is that, there was no mujahideen in kosovo\\n\\n\" kind of a stupid response given the name of the article. how the hell are you going to block me from editting?

it seems to be that you\\'re a loser who needs to brag that you troll wiki and block users who try to make the site a better place. most of your stuff is done in secret, but when somebody does expose you for being a trolling loser, you simply block them from even being able to talk on their own talk page. guess what? a person\\'s personal talk page is not yours for editing as it does not need to be factual. if it did, it would be the user\\'s facts page, not the talk page. it\\'s for talking, which you as a troll clearly wouldn\\'t want if that discussion revolved around you abusing your privileges as an admin. if the right people saw that they might take away those little jpg badges that you think are real and then your life would be worthless even to you, like it is to the rest of the world.\\n\\nit\\'s good to know that you guys are immature, childish, irrelevant trolls with absolutely nothing resembling a real life. hate anime\\ni hate anim wtf -  checkuser says i am a sockpuppet.  absolutely brilliant.  thanks mackensen! don\\'t be a fag\\n\\njust some advice. do with it what you will. later. \"\\n\\n i agree with user darcyj \\n\\nyou really need to polish up your english!!!!! over and over again you mispell simple words, for example- you write ignore as \"\"ignor\"\" or similiar. how can you expect to an effective editor when you cannot write in a grammatically and spelling correct fashion!!! second of all, to me, you are a very big hypocrite!!!!! you claim that indian administrators are being predijuice to you and playing \"\"favourites\"\" with you and other pakistani wikipedians when you a highly racist person yourself!!!!!! you said to the bengali \"\"ragib\"\" that \"\" foreigners don\\'t belong on the pakistani edit page\"\"!!!!!! if that isnt predijuice, what is????

that\\'s all i need to know. don\\'t give me the bullshit about sockpuppets either, you said if you vandalise wikipedia again as you \\'\\'\\'did to deep purple you will be blocked immetidely. (cant spell that.) if it was a sock puppet, you would have banned me immeditley. if you were reversing all my edits due to a sock puppet you wouldnt have said the part i bolded. so, the only logical answer is... i vandalised the band\\'s article known as deep purple. how. 142.162.164.114 can\\'t win! \\n\\nhahahahahahahahahah! did you think you could get away so easy? no matter what you do, one

spam, lazy insults, illiterate ramblings and screeching from morons who don\\'t listen (but just use the channel as their own forum) means i am anti free speech. i don\\'t think our ancestors fought

cares to look back through my channel they will see i actively encourage debate, but also see how so many choose to eschew debate in favour of:\\n1. attempting to belittle, hurl abuse and calling me uaf/marxist/far left/rapist/paedophile with absolutely no basis (libelous in reality).\\n2. personal insults, accusing me of being a foreigner, bringing my family into it (they love a \"\"mum\"\"

sources and only ever \"\"research\"\" or accept sources that back up their own beliefs.\\n4. lying, accusing me of acts i haven\\'t done and claiming they have \"\"won\"\" the argument when they have ignored the points i raised and just harped on and on.\\n5. cloning my account on here and also using my username on far right forums. they have cloned me numerous times.\\n6. waffling on about being deprived of freedom of speech (to make insults and allow no right to reply by blocking me from their channels)\\n\\nbasically, these goons make up a tiny minority of incredibly arrogant, ignorant, spiteful, indecent, amoral, borderline illiterate joy sappers; bnp, edl, neo nazis, islamophobes, extremists, kkk, you name it. they are what is wrong with the world and they are what is trying to stop us evolving; their motivation is hatred and ignorance....proven by their labelling of everyone who disagrees with them as communists, uaf, marxists and liberals (and more unbelievably fascists?!?) with no basis. of course, they are just lazy epithets to group the majority into one category when their opposition is made up of a multitude of individuals from left to right, of different coloured skin and beliefs, sexualities, classes, background etc....the majority basically.\\n\\nyoutube grants these guttersnipes the anonymity to parade their ignorance and disgusting ideals and appear to be a larger group than they are. they are fooling themselves though, they will always be a minority of failures who blame their own failure in life on everyone but themselves.

a dirty whore who is addicted to crack.  shoe began whoring herself out to gangs of african americans when she was 16 to support her habit.\\n\\none night, she conceived bongwarrior with one of her black pimps when she was 15.  after bongwarrior was born, she gave him to her pimps, who pimped him out too.  as a result, bongwarrior\\'s anus suffered extensive damage.  he cannot control his defectaroy patterns, as a result of which he has to wear diapers.\\n\\nbongwarrior hates it when ip-hopping vandals inform the world of the truth about his mother.  he also doesn\\'t realize that if he blocks an ip address, all the ip-hopping vandal has to do is weight for 10 minutes and then get a new ip address.  he is so retarted.  or maybe he can\\'t think because he is currently getting

have been tipped in this now cocky editor\\'s favour. you have to admit that complaining about an apologie on your talk page as harrassement it about as childish as the on looker that buys into his political antics. me thinks a meatpuppet or even a sockpuppet  case will arise from this nonsense in the future. i find it way to hard to believe that so many editors can not feel like total idiots when they get caught not doing more than three minutes of investigation before acting. i am disgusted and come to realize the wp system is a complete and utter embarrasing joke. gabe and i had an agreement (i won\\'t disclose the details to protect him) and after the plan began to work he turned on me like a rabid dog. some thanks. i disagreed with his edits and now watch him inject his non-approved the/the changes to pink floyd and other articles as  a cocky test to rape and pilage another few hundred music articles with his same the/the nonsense currently being mediated and under dispute. this guy isn\\'t interested in furthering wp. he only wants to have his name in lights with [wp:ownership]. i guess this ip is done and time to go back to account editing again. this was much more fun! bite me bitches! hasta luego! joe 99.251.125.65 \"start your own web page then! i long for the days of amateurish \"\"shrines\"\" to pop stars. the web was so much nicer when people did

to do that on the basis of baseless reports by vicious low-life scumbags who were out to do you harm. you writing that i am a \"\"crank\"\" etc. is exactly as bad as if i were to falsely accuse you of

been devoted to me), but article talk pages are for discussing the article, not for making personal attacks on other users. if you wish to give me feedback, i would be most interested to read it. the appropriate place for such postings is my userpage, not article or project space.\\nif you truly object to editors \"\"fiddling...and inteferring with some else\\'s words,\"\" then you might want to consider whether wikipedia is the right place for you. every time you make an edit, you acknowledge acceptance that your edits may be edited any number of times by any number of people. at the bottom of each edit page is this statement: \"\"if you don\\'t want your writing to be edited mercilessly or redistributed by others, do not submit it.\"\"\\ni strongly caution you about continuing to make personal attacks on other users. the community condemns personal attacks, and should you choose to continue making them, it will result in further and longer range blocks. it\\'s very easy to avoid such blocks by simply commenting on article content instead of editors. i\\'m sure we can all work together constructively and productively if we refrain from making comments about other users.\\ni am very pleased that you now have an account and i think this is a sign of good faith on your behalf. so thankyou for that. i hope we are able to get these issues resolved so you may be able to enjoy

this is absurd! what the hell happened? freedom of speech, i am all for it. but this constant bitching and whining about political correctness has gone too far. you cannot change the canadian national anthem because it is insulting \"\"immigrants\"\". they\\'re immigrants, they chose to come to canada, and it should be that they should respect our traditions -though keeping their customs and traditions, i have nothing against multiculturalism-. we cannot bend over backwards for people who have done nothing for the country! it\\'s like subjecting to bullying, it\\'s not bloody right! and the usage of \"\"god\"\" and \"\"son\"\" means nothing! it\\'s a traditional piece. i am an atheist, and an agnostic, yet i have no objection to prayer in my school\\'s chapel, to singing christian lyrics, because it pertains no meaning to me. are not god, jesus, allah, mohammed, buddha, and any other religious deity supposed to all be working for the same cause? should not they all be \"\"friends\"\"??? so may i ask what is the problem with the canadian anthem? allah, jesus, mohammed, buddha and god are all manifestations of the same person, thing, cause, reason! the canadian anthem is traditional, and it seems to me almost a sacrilege (if you may excuse the poor choice of word, as it seems to contradict my whole speech!) to complain about it being sexist, or bigotry. this ties in with the controversy over the queen. she is a testament to the tradition of canada, to remove her would be to follow in the footsteps of the united states. we are not yanks, we are members of the commonwealth. to get back on track, i state clearly, there is absolutely no logical, moral or respectful way that it can be stated to change the lyrics to a traditional song! a song is a song. you cannot opt to change the lyrics to a controversial popular song, like \"\"the beatles\"\"! you just don\\'t do it! so how should it be the same for the anthem? the anthem represents what canada is. it was established as christian, and though we gladly accept other cultures, we cannot change every damn thing to be politically correct for all the minorities out there. it\\'s impossible. freedom of speech has become the opposite. comedians can\\'t make jokes about religion, sexuality, gender without being complained at, reprimanded at by minorities. australia is a perfect example of how a country should be run. they say to immigrants: \"\"you make the choice to live here. that means you have to live with the way australians live, australian code, australian traditions. don\\'t come here expecting us to change just for you.\"\" this is how a country should be. it seems unfair that we should change everything to be politically correct, just so that some bleeding heart out there can go to their bed -oh, is that politically incorrect to the homeless? i\\'ll change that to \"\"area of rest\"\"- and not grumble and whine, prepared to get up the next morning and petition to change all the lyrics of gospel music, or to remove all films that even mention a religious deity in a disrespectful manner. please, i beg, i pray, (god forbid, heheheh) that we all come to our senses and realize \"\"don\\'t sweat the small stuff\"\". get on, toughen up, put your helmet on, keep on trucking. it\\'s an imperfect world, you can\\'t have your way all the time. if someone at high school insults you, you ignore it. you stay away from them. so? does that not apply to here? please, chew on this rather large- and i do apologize for its length- paragraph.\\n64.180.211.200  \\n\\n\" also, he is a bad person scrap the map. the 5-pic collage looks better. real pictures sum up the war better then some plain ass map animation. yep, that\\'s it, just some rice with a bit of extra crap on top. just like nasi goreng, in fact just like any other dish from the far east. yeesh, it\\'s not like real cultivated cooking, like what we have in germany.2.103.197.76 just delete my account you faggot!

years. those articles are not verfiable from any other source or book or on net. instead of deleting such pages, you made it an ego clash \"\"that i am an admin and i can do whatever i like\"\". otherwise you still have not posted a valid reason that why should those articles not be deleted. you got angry as i exposed your poor knowledge but this is a fact that britain\\'s time is over and so is your\\'s. be happy with your wikipedia and \"\"your privileges as an admin and keep forcing your thoughts on other by using your power as admin and in the similar fashion such articles will bring more and more credibility to wikipedia and to admin. keep your site and your pages , the thing which exposed once again that how britain is a coward country ,britain dont ruled hindu by force but by dividing hindu into caste and making their regiments otherwise we hindu would have taught you the same lesson which we taught to muslims and mughal empire and to durrani empire and to 500 million muslims of india,pakistan,bangladesh and afghanistan.\\n\\nhope to never see a sore loser like you and neither this site who have entrusted responsibility on people like you, what you want to portray by defending those two articles. the reality is that no true wikipedia admin will allow those articles without any citation for years to be on wikipedia but you want those two articles not because those articles are great but because of your ego which i exposed that people like you never accept mistake. who dont have courage to accept their mistake, instead rant about english, grammar and all that. i dont need english , i am a hindu my language is hindi, even if i can speak 10% of english i am more brilliant than you as you filthy scum cant speak even 1% of hindi. \\n  \" (screencapped

ok, if that is so, then i understand. don\\'t be such a sandy vagina. leave it to a fag to be such a let down. people are just having fun editing joke pages. no real person would ever sight wikipedia as a credible source. your job and everything you do is worthless. you\\'re worthless as a human being. take the dick out of your ass and calm down. you are very hypocritical why don\\'t you knock it off with the constant reverting images to the 4, b and l train articles will y whatever gave you the impression that i have the slightest interest in your opinion? wanker. u wanna suck me off do it thats us cut your dick off, do us all a favor, you little asshol lonelyboy \\n stop writing messages to lonelyboy on my page. that\\'s probably how a lot of crap was started here before because of you making mistakes like that. anyway, do not address other people on my talk page. i rarely use wikipedia, but when i do and i have problems with people like you, i use my ip address. lonelyboy should have done the same thing so jerks like you couldn\\'t get him banned by way of his account name. i\\'m calling you a jerk for your personal attacks on my page and your recent bouts with lonelyboy and teaming up with this hybrid person who is also using you, a close friend, to become an administrator probably because he can\\'t get people he doesn\\'t know to have him become one. i will ignore any crap you write on my userpage. if you\\'re not an old lefty then you don\\'t even have that excuse for this stupid deletion - at least old lefties are acting on their beliefs. this is a biographical article. the location of his funeral is a biographical fact, and since someone (not me) has seen fit to include it, it will stay unless a good reason is given for deleting it. on matters like this, yes, i am used to getting my own way and i usually do. getting really annoyed\\nok the list here is barely usable.  it sucks.  i don\\'t think we should change it because the arcs and other useful information supposedly don\\'t fit here. but why cant i put a simple link to a website that does have that information????  that website has all kinds of valuable information that is directly related to the article.  yet some wikinazi thinks that this is his personal article and keeps making up some bs about how my link is a form of advertisement or some shit.  there are no ads.  it is another wiki site, and it is 100% on topic with useful information that everyone keeps trying to add to this article.  since he won\\'t let his personal wiki site be altered with useful information then let me keep the link.  i\\'m so sick of pedantic fools making wikipedia so useless and difficult to use.  i get that this page should reflect wiki-standards but that link i added is 100% relevant and is far more justified than plenty of external links i\\'ve seen on other pages. you are simply a backstabber, i was to defend you during the rfar. while multiple socks and contributors discuss with eachothers privatly, you backstab me by cheap threats when i never did such things to you, but of course such contributors will never be threatned by backstabbers like this. i have from the beginning tried to help you, i have even proposed to boost your credibility by neutralising your propositions, i have emailed you works and proposed you to help me, and at the first occasion you backstab me for a single citation about npov and you. you could have requested explainations, you decided to threaten me. and true, other armenians have indeed witnessed all this affair.

above! gurubrahma, please see the following examples of lies from just today, and here i\\'ll quote what i wrote to him earlier: \\n\\n kindly please stop lying if you wish me to stop pointing out your lies. it\\'s very rude and disrespectful when i spend my time citing verifiable and reliable sources and you just lie outright, nevermind content, but even on just simply what\\'s happening here, and here\\'s an example of just how you just now did it before requesting that i stop calling you \"\"liars\"\"; from wikipedia:wikiquette_alerts#december_8, i quote your statement and my reply to it:\\n\\n quoted: \"\"i hope that now since all editors have reached a consensus on the article, and have tried to explain you in clearest possible words the difference between numeral symbols and numeral system, you would play a more constructive role. thanks.   \\n\\n quoted: why are you lying again here? yes, lying! as you had been doing for quite some time now and as i have pointed out. the dictionary defines a lie as \"\"1. a false statement deliberately presented as being true; a falsehood. 2. something meant to deceive or give a wrong impression.\"\" first of all, \"\"all editors have reached a consensus on the article\"\" is a demonstrable false statement that you should know is not true and that we\\'re having this exchange here is evidence enough that it isn\\'t, nevermind others. second, here\\'s your other big lie, you say others \"\"have tried to explain you in clearest possible words the difference between numeral symbols and numeral system\"\", oh really? why don\\'t you tell everyone here that it is i who made the clearest distinction and as far as i remember and see on the page i was the first to make it between numeral symbols and numeral system, and you should know because you have been around. i clearly distinguished in my first post between the arabic numerals (1, 2, 3, 4...) and the hindu-arabic numeral system in a paraphragh that begins with \"\"- for a start,\"\" talk:history_of_indian_and_arabic_numerals#rfc_2 and you should especially know, not just because youhave been around, but also because what you quoted above happens to be just the paragraph under it!  and again i made the distinction in \"\"the clearest possible words\"\" when i proposed here, as my first(!) point in an suggested outline,  talk:history_of_indian_and_arabic_numerals#suggested_outline.2c_please_consider_and_discuss \"\"differentiate a specific numeral script (eg, arabic western, arabic eastern, devanagari) from the numeral system (ie, indian-arabic, which includes many numerals scripts), the rest of the article should maintain this, it should also keep in mind what the readers may have searched for when looking up this article and cater for those needs (eg, is the reader looking up the arabic western numerals script or the indian-arabic numeral system?)\"\", and then again zocky, who prefers my version and is against yours, made the same disctinction talk:history_of_indian_and_arabic_numerals#what_this_page_is_about. the dictionary defines a liar as \"\"one that tells lies\"\" and \"\"a person who has lied or who lies repeatedly\"\", if you want me to stop calling pointing out your lies stop lying! csssclll ()\"\"\\n\\n in addition, i did *not* start the pov fork (alternative views on arabic

to your question, i\\'d say an editor is no longer a newbie when they have a reasonable command of how wikipedia works, such that they do not make false accusations of copyright infringement, make a point of communicating with image uploaders, and familiarize themselves with the right way to communicate with members of the community.\\n\\n\"\"if you believe images should be retained without there

critical of.  this does not illegitimise it.  there are many and varied very legitimate criticism.  one such criticism is why a hate-monger such as yourself is not banned from wikipedia.  perhaps you

i win. i literally have about 17 other accounts that have absolutely nothing to do with \"\"vost\"\", \"\"elliotjoyce\"\", or \"\"accreditor\"\", and i\\'ve used those accounts to transform wikipedia articles to match my tastes, which usually means countering the racist garbage from pseudo-intellectual cancers like you sweety. see, from all of the edits i do, you dumb idiots pick up only a fraction to revert- while i\\'ve been keeping you busy with vost socks (which itself is a sock of another account), i\\'ve committed over 200 edits under the radar from special-proxy rotations in the last 4 days. i have 2 admin accounts, 5 non-admin accounts of previously active users which i\\'ve since been able to commandeer (more on this later), and about 10 standard self-created accounts. what\\'s even more hilarious is that the reverts engendered by my socks usually cause enough notice to the article that i don\\'t even have to do anything to get my views to dominate: i let other users add fuel to the fire that i started. but you know what the absolute kicker to all of this is? i got you, yes you, you jew-wannabe, black racist cancer smear, to violate numerous wikipedia policies and your own wikipedia philosophy by going after me, vendetta style. i broke you on your own terms. and even after all that, my major points and edits prevailed. i win, and considering that your power level on wikipedia is considerably more entrenched than my own, my victory is that much more devastating. the ip i\\'m using at the moment, courtesy of the 24-hour computer lab in my dorm, is about 1 of thousands of batch ips i have access to, which gives me even greater security and privilege to spread myself over wikipedia in case my special proxy rotation is ever categorized as a proxy, and thus blocked. oh, and regarding the commandeering of accounts: graphical analysis password bypass and deconstruction (gapbad) is a rather effective means to obliterate captcha; its use is only feasible at specific time intervals when security measures on the target fluctuate or do not register properly. guess which account is getting targeted next as soon as wikipedia undergoes its next server hash? ). you\\'ve been warned in advance. just remember: i win. you can\\'t do anything to me. go back to being a jew-wannabe sweety. jews are white, not black. remember that too- that\\'s why you\\'re not accepted and never will be accepted by mainstream judaism or western society as jewish. owned. how\\'s that taste? l m f a o.\" this is ridiculous. you use the name of a great dead man; and try to fit me into your schemes. tell us who you are, what is your name, religion, country. did you take the name of diderot because of his hate to the church?\\nshamir \"\\nthat is absolutely false.\\nyou posted a \"\"civility warning\"\" in my talk page.\\nthat was the only time that you posted there, ever, for this issue.\\nmy reaction to that, was to come here to ask what happened.\\nwe discussed it here, and when the discussion ended, without any result, i removed the civility warning from my talk page, because i use to archive / remove old conversations in my talk page.\\nautomatically, wen you saw i had removed the civility warning, you blocked me for a 24 hour period.\\nyour block was absolutely illegitimate, for various reasons:\\nthe way you did it:\\nthe reason you gave to block me was: \"\"yes, i\\'ve seen the comment on your talk page. this was the combination of mine and his responses to your previous question.\"\". and few minutes later, you posted \"\"24 hour block issued\"\".\\nall this information was posted in your own talk page, and talking to another user.\\nyou did not communicate to me that you had blocked me. i did not see that you had blocked me until, few days later the block had expired, i came to your talk page, and saw that you had said that you had blocked me.\\nin addition, by not communicating me that i was blocked, you did not allow me to ask other admins to review my block.\\nthe reasons why you did it:\\nit is not stated anywhere in this wikipedia that an user cannot remove stuff from his talk page.\\nyou neither told me not to remove that stuff.\\ni accepted and fulfilled your request of having a civil attitude. ignoring what i had done before (which was not much), since the moment you told me that, i kept a civil attitude.\\ni also lost my time coming here to reply you, so there is no possible way to say that i ignored your request.\\nin all, your block was just full of irregularities. it was not a normal admin block, but rather a thoughtless decission that you took without following any kind of procedure. you just decided that i had to be blocked because you might think that removing the civility warning that you had posted in my talk page was some kind of lack of respect towards you. but it is frankly stupid to think that way, because of the reasons i\\'ve explained above.\\nand since you realized that you had comitted an enormous mistake, that you had used your admin powers despotically, you just repeatedly ignored the requests that i did to you in your own talk page, where i asked you why had you blocked me (this one, and this one), adding to your unjustified attitude towards me, a high grade of arrogance.\\nin addition, you are threatening me. read well what i wrote:\\n\"\"hello? why did you block me? since when removing a civility warning from one\\'s talk page is something that deserves a block? you did not even communicate my block to my talk page. i am stil waiting for a justification of your abusive attitude as admin. you not only block for no reason but you also ignore people\\'s requests of justification!\"\".\\nwhere do you see a lack of respect here? where do you see that i \"\"keep\"\" an uncivil attitude? honestly, you are the one being uncivil: \"\"if you carry on in the line you are takng, you will be blocked again\"\" ... which line i am takng? and why do you threaten me? \"\"if you do not wish to contribute constructively to the encyclopedia, then we shall make sure that you do not prevent others from contributing\"\" ... oh, \"\"we\"\". this sounds to me more like a street gang threatening a poor pedestrian, than an admin giving wise advices to a poor wikipedian. go to my user page and see the articles i\\'ve created. isn\\'t that a positive contribution?\\nlook: i am not being uncivil; it is you, the one being disrespectful with me. and i am not ignoring your requests of being civil; i am fulfilling them. and it is rather you, who are not only ignoring my requests of justification for the actions you carried out against me, but also threatening me with new repressive measures.  \" i hope you can crap out your butt \\n\\nvbecaues its your face you buttface i\\'ll detlete everythig \", darn, darn.  keep this here and off my page or i\\'ll file another complaint.  i\"\"m done!!!!  he gone!!!!  ka-booooooom!!!! \" , you are making a fool of yourself!! this is not edit-warring!! are you crazy??

peopel who vote to keep palmer up on the grounds that he is openly gay, or has a large number of publications, or has 13000 google hits, voting to delete me, even though i have similar criteria. it makes it seem arbitrary to me. so can you blame me for monitoring this a little bit, and being a bit frustrated at the seemingly arbitrary actions of some people?

(and i contributed a lot in a short time and would have contributed so much more had i continued. things that i did: huge amounts of professional class photography given away for free (placed pd) on subjects (often providing the only pics, to this day, on the subjects in question), hundreds of pages formatted according to standards, huge amounts of latest subject matter information added and facts corrected (in some cases so new that this was the first place on the net to have it) etc. etc.) - and instead of helping me and being civil, sensible and using common sense you were more interested in defending a non-contributing user who (for no apparent reason) started a campaign of open violent threats, death threats, spamming and vandalism on me. you were having too much fun abusing your moderator privileges by placing temporary blocks on me, trying to stop me from making my point and trying to give this hugely offensive other user a chance to avoid a police investigation, by mod-vandalizing discussions on the subject etc. - against most other moderators (private) views even - they had the sense not to start a mod war on the subject. your 500 page nerd-o-pedia rule-book and abusing it to the point of idiocy was more interesting to you. apparently you felt that since you had read it, everyone else should waste at least as much time and read it too down to every last letter, or you were gonna use it against all common sense toward anyone who didn\\'t - with no regard for the actual situation and reasons behind it, no regard for that individuals contributions, no regard for civility - and most of all, with no common sense applied whatsoever.\\n\\nit\\'s indeed too bad that most pages on nerd-o-pedia are starting to be shockingy un-maintained and obsolete, indeed dead now that the initial rush of contributors is over after a few years, and the fun is over for most people - as, the most brutal blow of all, moderators such as you have managed to destroy the morale of even the most serious contributors and have had them leave. they simply did not wish to spend too much time arguing or alternatively face putting up with arrogant admin behavior, because it always will start to take more of your time than contributions here, because of people like you, and how wrong the principles are how admins are selected here. it\\'s all about brown-nosing with the crowd and building your giant online virtual ego and lick the ass of other even more ocd nerds who are already admins, and you\\'re just a wannabe. \\n\\ngood ****ing luck trying to get anything edited or updated here in a year or two besides top 10 whatever pop bands may be popular at the time, the latest tv show pages and some other obsessive-compulsive nerdishm. nobody is foolish enough to put up with the crap that comes along with the job, from people such as you.\\n\\nfor example, the pages on my subjects were very active till late 2006, and since that they have... well. remained in the same form as the core contributors left them, as they left this site. no updates. i\\'m truly not the only one to eject. not worth the effort to contribute when all you get is shitted all over, if you ever need any help.\\n\\nit\\'s kind of funny that an admin can burn out of this site too, but given your attitude back then, i\\'m not surprised you did. after all, there were some decent admins here back then (such as  ), and i\\'m sure there\\'s a few now, but way too many nerds for whom it is the biggest thing of their lives, and they have to show it, and snoop their noses everywhere. but like i said, as even admins are dropping out, what do you think happened to the contributors? many pages now are actually full of incorrect shit, because no people of expertise hang around any more to correct details, and newbies or worse, malicious trollers slowly degrade the content that once was at least somehow accurate and relevant. admins will be happy to see updates to the page, but the fact is, most of the updates today are degenerating the pages, obfuscating subjects and adding factual errors and garbage.\\n\\nand too bad you didn\\'t quit a year ago, i might still be here, and there would probably be several thousands of lines, and few hundred articles more, along with maybe ~1000 more photographs.\\ngood riddance!! by the way i wasn\\'t joking when i welcomed athenian very politely to the albanian page.wikipedia sucks! jehovah\\'s witnesses are a bunch of cultish freaks and they need to go ahead and drink the \\'kool-aid\\' now and stop knocking on my farking door and shove their hateful version of god up their arses!!!65.69.81.2 royal just name. user:cossde / royal college, colombo not owner.\\nrestaurants, hair saloons, travel agents, elders homes, shops named royal with out royal charter jobless sick wiki fucker. /|  /|  |    hello, i am gay       |\\n                         ||__||  |    welcome to the        |\\n                        /   o o\\\\__        site of           |\\n                       /          \\\\       gilliam!          |\\n                      /      \\\\     \\\\   i murder puppies     |\\n                     /   _    \\\\     \\\\ \\n                    /    |\\\\____\\\\     \\\\     ||\\n                   /     | | | |\\\\____/     ||\\n                  /       \\\\|_|_|/   |    __||\\n                 /  /  \\\\            |____| ||\\n                /   |   | /|        |      |\\n                |   |   |//         |____  |\\n         * _    |  |_|_|_|          |     \\\\-/\\n      * _\\\\ _ \\\\     //           |\\n        /  _     \\\\\\\\ _ //   |        /\\n      *  /   \\\\_ /- | -     |       |\\n        *      ___ c_c_c_c/ \\\\c_c_c_c____________ winkers6767\\n\\ndearest david:\\n\\ni just blocked your mom.\\n\\nsincerely, what the hell is with everybody making etna articles?

you are talking nonsense again. the reconstructed pronunciation is not a modern theory nor has it been substantiated by modern linguists. repeating the same old 19th century out of date fallacies in a modern book does not constitute evidence or substantiation. the only differnece between modern linguists repitition of these fallacies and the original is that the modern linguists have removed all of the racist slurs from the original work (well most of them anyway) and have included the disclaimer that none of the nonsense they are regurgitating is provable given the historical evidence, or rather the complete lack of it, and modern research which is unanimously against the theory. thanos papadimitrakopulos publication is a perfectly valid source since it postdates the standard form of the reconstructed pronunciation that is still taught today (a theory that is never substantiated to students but is taught as unproven dogma) and he has never been refuted. chrys c. caragounis is a linguistics expert and a philologist and is thus a valid source. development of greek and the new testament, mohr siebeck (isbn 3161482905) is his most recent publication a probable the most recent research on ancient greek pronunciation in existence. anyone claiming to be an expert in ancient greek that still believes in the reconstructed pronunciation has no right to be called an expert since it is like believing in the ptolemaic earth centred universe which observations have shown to be wrong. all of the experts in semitic linguistics are against the reconstructed pronunciation of ancient greek since they make it perfectly clear that ancient greek was pronounced like modern greek at the time the septuagint was translated from the original hebrew in 280 bc. this therefore implies that classical greek must have been pronounced like modern greek as well otherwise 72 hebrew expert who were taught ancient greek as children 50 years earlier would not have associated the proto-semitic fricative gimel in gomorra which was no longer used in the written language but was only spoken as a breath with the greek letter gamma. gamma therefore must have been fricative and there a myriads of other examples that semitic linguists use to show that ancient greek was pronounced like modern greek and that the hebrew alphabet represented the mediae and dasea and z as fricatives. it is clear from the study of semitic linguistics and from experts in the filed like caragounis and papadimitrakopulos that the reconstructed pronunciation is a racist sham based on germanic supremacy (as can be seen from the slurs in the papers of is original creators) and an affront to science and the only reason why it is still being tangut is for ethnocentric reasons alone. don\\'t butt in to what doesn\\'t concern you, especially with threats. stupid! you\\'re the one who stops for massive and undiscussed removal on the article. also, you say you\\'re interest in chinese history well then go for it and don\\'t ever pay attention to vietnamese history. 69.234.181.115 and i\\'ll add, ban me forever, douche. \"give up?

days... what a bunch of nutcases.. sex in space\\nsweet. thanks for the education! ) please stop vandalising my writings in the dog article \\n\\nnothing in my writing here is controvertial and in need of citation. it can all be looked up by the reader on any level. do you need citations that dogs did not decend thousands of years ago from the wolves that are alive today, as most people believe? do i need proof that they decended thousands of years ago from the wolves that lived thousands of years ago? why does this need citation? is this your problem? i am merely pointing out the error that so many, many people make. they hear that dogs decended from wolves, and they look around and see the only wolves left in the world in any number today are the wolves of northern lattitudes...they see the grey wolf of northern eursaia and the timber wolf of north america, and believe that all dogs decended from them. humans are a tropical creature that moved into the colder regions. everywhere man goes, wolf populations dwindle, as anybody knows, and in ancient times, before man, there were wolves all over the world, adapted to their own climates. what part of this needs citation? obviously, the first dogs to be bred were the ones where the people first lived, which is obviously the warmer climates, and it was these wolves that gave rise to most of our dog breeds, not the northern wolves. now the wolves of the colder regions are the only ones left in number, the wolves in warmer places, where dogs were first bred, are almost all gone. some northern breeds decended from northern wolves, yes. the spitz breeds and sled dogs, etc. this is all so obviuous, can you tell me what part of this you don\\'t understand, and need citations about? i feel like i am talking to a child. if i tell my child that george washington was the first president, to i have to give a citation? this stuff doesn\\'t need citation.\\n\\nyou are a vandal, because you, as the only person on earth who doesn\\'t agree with this, erased three whole paragraphs, not once but twice, on the grounds that there were no references, even though much larger tracts of the article are more controvertial and have no citations. you erased every word i wrote, even though all of it is true, none of it is controversial, and this is nothing but pure vandalism.\\n\\nyou need citation that dogs interbreed with coyotes? why? how can you not already know that? how is this possible? and articles about the russian jackal-dog hybrid are all over the web. can you use a search engine? look up the pre-caudal gland in any veterinary text. things that are controvertial or new need citations to the new or controvertial sources, but when something become so widely-known that it can be found in every reference work out there, it no longer needs specific citation. for anything i wrote, you can look it up in britannica. if you read something that you did not know, it doesn\\'t mean the author needs to cite references for you, it just means you need to do your own homework. i am merely pointing out the things that are such a big part of common knowledge, and using them to prove that dogs did not all decend entirely from modern wolves of the colder climate where people didn\\'t even live when dogs were first domesticated. in all my years of veterinary practice, i have probably told 100\\'s of my patients that dogs decended from warm-climate wolves, not all of them come from the northern wolves. now, after all these years, i am confronted by a web vandal who tells me i have to cite freaking references about this. it is purely annoying. \\n\\nif you erase my writings again i will report you as a vandal. really, do not do it again.\\n\\nmorgan wright hey, you squinty-eyed

you have created for yoruself in your mind.  nearly all your \"\"contributions\"\" to wikipedia have been about promoting your fake image, especially your uncultured fucking qajar turks and your lizzard-munching arab ancestors and basically, your \"\"contributions\"\" can be summed up as \"\"fake image with pretty pictures\"\" (may i say that the pictures are not nearly as \"\"pretty\"\" as you think, by the way?).  also, your behaviour in wikipedia clearly shows the half-arab/half-turkish blood.  you act exactly, 100% like a half-arab/half-turk boor, with zero tolerance and respect for others and zero sense of compromise and zero sign of culture or civility.  last but not least, if you think the khums financial aid and social programmes for the  sayyeds is not true, and if you have even one single cell of brain in your vacuous cramium, why don\\'t you ask yoruself then what exactly \"\"sahme sadaat\"\" part of the khums means?  does it mean \"\"portion for the movie stars\"\"?!  you really are dumb, aren\\'t you?  and if you still have doubts, since you are from a mullah, sayyed family, i am sure you know that you can write to any of the ayatollahls offices or the howza and ask them any question you want.  simply ask them what \"\"sahme sadaat\"\" portion of the khums exactly means.\\n\\nlast but not least, the persian art picture that you have uploaded, you have characterized it as \"\"the artist mixes blah blah with qajar art\"\"  ... that is 100% bullshit.  can you provide a link that says the artist has indeed made such claim?  that is your claim, because you are from a fucking qajar turk family.  i will change it unless you can provide a reliable link that supports that claim (i.e., it must clearly show that the artist has made such a claim).\"

*never* represented 1/3 as 0.333... \\n\\nnow let me refute your argument regarding the transitive property:\\n\\na)    1=3(1/3)\\nb)    3(1/3) = 3(0.333...)\\nc)    3(0.333...) =0.999... \\n\\nthe problem here occurs in b) where you assume that 3 * 0.333... = 3 * 1/3. you have \\'not proved\\' anything. on the contrary, you have only proved that you are assuming 1/3 = 0.333... which it is obviously \\'not equal\\'. 0.333... is an \\'indeterminate\\' number because it cannot be represented finitely in base 10. \\n0.333... is not equal to 1/3 so you cannot say that 1/3 is a finite representation. an indeterminate number is a number that is repeating in any\\nradix system.\\n\\nyou mention the division algorithm but do you know what it says? the division algorithm has \\'nothing\\' to do with radix systems. let me state it for you - if a and b are two given integers, there are unique integers q and r\\nsuch that a=bq + r and  0<= r < b. now i will use the division algorithm to prove that you are wrong once and for all. suppose a = 1 and b = 0.999..., then \\nwhat are the integers q and r such that the above is true?\\n\\nsuppose that q = 0 and r = 1. then the division algorithm fails because it makes a false statement i.e. q and r can both be 0 and 1 respectively.\\nfor example: 1 = (0.999...)(1)+0 and 1 = (0.999...)(0)+1. so by default, the\\ndivision algorithm is proved false if 0.999... is equal to 1. and you can say a lot of things about the greeks, but they would not make a stupid mistake like this. they were the smartest race in ancient times.\\n\\nnow suppose that you try to tell me that either form is acceptable in the case of 0 and 1, you will still end up with a terrible contradiction:\\n\\n1=(0.999...)(0)+1. the second form in this case implies that 1 < 0.999... since r < b. but how can 1 be less than 0.999... ??!!\\n\\ni want the world to know what f..g idiots run this site. you are a bunch of retarded, conceited fools who

graduation, all three of us were together again. from the enthusiastic hugs at the airport and then the conversation and laughter during the dinner we shared at a local restaurant on the way to my home, it was clear that while plenty of time had passed and we had kept in contact, the comfort and attraction between the three of us when all together in the same physical location was still undeniable.\\n\\nhaving returned to my cozy, semi-secluded home in the suburbs, we all sat in the living room, sipping wine and continuing the tales of our lives. with the exceptions of the location – a house – and the presence of alcohol, it could have been any of our final two years of college together: the three of us, tight-knit friends-with-benefits, sitting and chatting and sharing a drink together. then, justine and beth had been roommates while i lived in another dorm across the main quad; now, they were much-welcomed guests who had fortunately been able to clear time in their hectic schedules to come and visit me for a weekend.\\n\\nas i sat in the recliner and took another sip of wine, i allowed my eyes to truly linger on justine as she told beth about a recent situation at work. the florida sun had certainly added a glow to justine\\'s skin, and may have also been responsible for the lighter shade of her shoulder-length brown hair. as when we were in college together, she wore virtually no make-up, just a thin gloss upon her lips – an enticing strawberry flavor, as i had discovered upon meeting her at the airport earlier in the evening – and red fingernails. her red dress was indeed elegant, with a plunging sequined neckline that permitted a very welcome display of her cleavage, a display which beth and i both certainly appreciated. the long slit up the skirt of the dress revealed that she was wearing stockings held up by a garter belt, one of its descending white straps definitely noticeable against the well-toned thigh. the red heels provided enough of a contrast for the white stockings to truly attract the eyes. surprisingly, however, she wore hoop earrings, something she had never worn during college for fear that they would pull at her ears and widen the piercing holes more than was considered safe.\\n\\nthe conversation turned back toward me, but a few minutes later, the two beautiful young women were again chatting primarily to each other. i took the opportunity to once again study beth, and was equally impressed. while noticeably shorter than justine, beth was also paler in complexion, a testament to living in northern canada ever since graduation and spending virtually every waking moment inside to conduct her research. as in college, beth preferred the color black for her outfits: a somewhat-tight sweater, form-fitting slacks, and a pair of low heels. four tiny earrings adorned each ear, plus she bore a small sparkling stud against her left nostril. beth\\'s black hair flowed over her shoulders and down her front, and she absently twirled several strands around a finger as she listened to justine.\\n\\nit felt so good to be in their presence once again. especially since all three of us had been in several failed relationships since graduating from college, i was thankful that i had thought to invite them to spend the weekend with me. i had absolutely no doubt that our chatter would eventually give way to intimacy, but for now, i was quite content to simply sit back in the recliner and openly admire the two stunning beauties perched upon the sofa.\\n\\nthe intimacy began when we finally went to bed... together. i was on my back under the covers, with a very feminine head resting softly upon each shoulder. an arm wrapped around each of them, i held the two women close to me as they absently stroked my bare chest, dipped a finger into my navel, brushed my thighs through the sweatpants i typically wore to bed, caressed my stiffening manhood. my eyes closed, i reveled in their touches: inherently familiar, yet full of rediscovery due to the lengthy passage of time.\\n\\nno words were needed. and as their hands occasionally made contact with each other upon me, i smiled to myself in the darkness, having always enjoyed watching beth and justine in their own intimate encounters. but eventually, their touches slowed and ultimately ceased, their breathing falling into the regularity associated with sleep. i stayed awake a little longer, immensely enjoying the closeness with two of the people who had been most important in my life.\\n\\ni awoke in the morning to the scent of french roast coffee, faint yet unmistakable. justine was gone, clearly the one who had brewed the morning nectar, while beth and i held each other as she slept. the feel of her pajama-covered breasts against me was a welcome sensation, as it h i have no life, and if i don\\'t get to ever have sex then i will make everyone\\'s life i can as miserable as possible! \"\\n\"\"please\"\",

it is fairly obvious that those three users namely seb az86556 , seric2 and chesdovi are clearly constantly creating a picture of nicosia as a decadent muslim city that serves their religious beliefs and are all clearly hailing form turkish backgrounds.\\n\\nthere is a constant undermining of the city´s greek identity i.e. whenever a greek flag appears in any single picture the aforementioned users delete that picture instantaneously and prefer to throw in pictures of the flag of \"\"shame\"\" and occupation that is equivalent to a legalisation of a human crime of continuous brutal occupation of the island of cyprus by the turkish army.\\n\\nthe greek flag is omnipresent in the republic of cyprus whether some people like it or detest it but this is the reality and an encyclopedia that wishes to be unbiased should depict the reality and not the subjective views of a minority of readers that are furthermore based on extremist religious and nationalistic views. on the other hand, such users do find it appropriate to throw in pictures using the turkish and the illegal, yes illegal according to united nation referendums flat of the non-recognised internationally illegal self-proclaimed state of the so-called trnc.\\n\\nit is totally unacceptable to have extremist nationalistic individuals, that strategically reached the level of administrators, deteriorating all the time the article on the city of nicosia, promoting an unrealistic turkish character and undermining the greek character of the city and at the same time having an additional article on \"\"north nicosia\"\" that is depicting a totally false picture w.r.t the city. the trnc is illegal, not recognised by any state other than turkey and some terrorist states that are non-democratic and yet wikipedia has a page on northern nicosia by supposedly administrators that support the unification of cyprus. this is clearly a major distortion of their intentions and a huge lie in that an individual that pretends to be a neutral aribtrator and a supoporter of reunification cannot have a separate page on northern nicosia stressing how turkish it is and then go and literally destroy everything in the proper page for nicosia and emphasize the turkish character of the city, talk about the tension and the division of the city all the time and undermine the greek character.\\n\\nthis is clear nationalistic and racial discrimination against the indisputable greek character of the area controlled by the republic of cyprus and furthermore it is downgrading for the republic of cyprus the mere fact that wikipedia has a site that is constantly vandalised by several ethnic turkish extremists and wikipedia users support such discriminatory behaviour.\\n\\nin the light of all of this, i shall stop contributing to wikipedia as i consider it downgrading for my own self. furthermore, i do not wish to participate in an \"\"encyclopedic\"\" project that is totally biased and discriminatory.\\n\\nmarcobadotti (talk) \" ur such stupid u idiot \\n\\ni hate u i hate u i hate u i hate u i hate u i hate u i hate u i hate u i hate u i hate u i hate u i hate u i hate u i hate u i

removing what was not discussed on talk pages and content which you are well aware will cause troubl you shut your mouth. and my contributions will never be missed — as long as there are several

people, so you edited the han chinese page and changed the infobox, changing a famous scientist like zhang heng to an actress that nobody in the world cares. honestly the way wiki is treating this is a joke\\n\\na. i could have cited news sites but since when is a news site worthy of an academic cite?\\n\\nb. if the person that wanted peer review felt like it, he would have sought it 20 years ago, he chose not to do it, but none the less his work is known and was mentioned in many math related \\'forums\\' and most ignored it. \\n\\nc. only the recent 2012 open source test of the work proved the 30mod algorithm is a major thing in math, again, github is a programmers resource and it was not until a computer used the actual 30mod algorithm that it was shown to be a \\'big thing\\' and since then some news sites have covered it, but i chose not to cite them due to imo they are not npov. but none the less they covered the story.\\n\\nd. the fact is a major computer site where programmers have free reign to challenge any claims exists and for over two years not one programmer challenged the findings.\\n\\ne. so what if the person that discovered it works outside of academia and has no regard for normal \\'peer review\\' the fact is he has no peers if you ask some in academia that know of his work, and i am one of those people that know of the work and how brilliant the work is.\\n\\nnow to summarize, we have a bunch of pags about primes on wiki, and even pages created after his discovery that use his discovery (ie. the sieve of atkin 60mod work is his work discussed in the public forum and usenet math and physics forums is where he chose to discuss his amazing work.\\n\\nso now you have 2004 sieve of atkin using a 60mod algorithm, guess what that was in his 1995 paper. so does wiki acknowledge that? no. and i didn\\'t even bother to waste my time of the 60 mod algorithm since the big deal as you are saying is the pyprimes test and i cited that very well, it\\'s a program created in python, i cited the wiki python page, then i cited github for both pyprimes and the pyprimes testing.\\n\\nnow while math is m forte, i am sufficient enough in computer skills to understand what github is and to understand how to read the speed tests and the prime spirals smoked every algorithm there is. now anyone can download python (which i have done) and download pyprimes (which i have done) and run the tests. guess what just like a math experiment, it is duplicated.\\n\\nso github and the tests which are not \\'new\\' should be enough to begin a wiki page on this truly amazing discovery in math.\\n\\ni myself became aware of the first paper in 1995, as did others in aademia. recently i became aware of \\'news sites\\' running stories citing what i copied, the links to the github tests.\\n\\nwhile some here can say well it\\'s not ama, so what, in the world of primality testing primes spirals as per the pyprimes results shows prime spirals are a big deal.\\n\\nnow i tried to be npov in giving all sides of the story, adoni has a valid 1995 claim i can verify it and i chose not to. but i cited a drexel math forum and i could have cited many other math sites discussing his 30mod, 60mod and 90mod prime work in the 1990\\'s. is this signficant? you bet it is since 60mod prime sieve aka atkin sieve is 20004 so his 60mod prime work is well before it.\\n\\nnow the github tests mentions \\'croft spirals\\', that\\'s due to in 2010 a person named croft registering a web site and ripping off the 1995 work. my opinion.\\n\\nnow croft can say all he wants that he found it playng his guitar or whatever he is claiming.\\n\\nthe fact is anyone can document adoni with prime theory from the 1990\\'s saying 30mod, 60mod and 90mod is the key.\\n\\n9 years later sieve of atkin appears, well that\\'s only a rehash of the adoni 60mod work from the 1990\\'s. yet no one is giving him credit.\\n\\n2010 croft puts out his 30mod work and its inserted into pyprimes on github and it smokes every major prime algorithm there is and all of them have pages on wiki as i cited.\\n\\nso 2012 a work on github verifies how important to primality the 30mod spirals are, but he says croft spirals, well guess what helixq is now out there and taking 100% credit for the 1995 work of dr. adoni.\\n\\nmy site to a drexel math site from the 1990\\'s mentioning 30mod prime work (prime spirals) is a major cite, since adoni could care less about the ama or whatever, in all probability he will soon be nominated for a nobel on his work, that is how important it is. \\n\\nthink about it, not one prime algorithm could beat the ancient sieve of eratosthenes, none of them. on a computer creating primes all other algorithms are terribly slow. the only two fast generators from scratch are the ancient sieve of eratosthenes and the prime spirals, and the winner was prime spirals. now i can cite recent news articles about it, laughing at academics it links to that said it was no big deal in the 1990\\'s who now all look foolish du stop erasing the truth fag.\\'\\'\\'\\n== \\n headline text \\n\\n== \\n headline text \\n ==\\n == \"\\n\\nnaconkantari vandal

ALL the east asian people I've spoken to thinks of Vietnam as a very integral part of SEA, and we all think you're backward, dirty and speak in a horrible swearing language.
